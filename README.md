# 🕵️‍♂️ Data Detective 🕵️‍♂️

In every messy dataset, there’s a mystery waiting to be solved.

I’m Vraj - part engineer, part detective, fully obsessed with turning raw data into real stories. For the past 3 years, I’ve been uncovering hidden trends, decoding complex pipelines, and translating chaos into clarity.  

My toolkit? The usual suspects: **Databricks, AWS, Snowflake, dbt**, with a bit of **GCP** experimentation on the side. Whether it’s building a rock-solid data pipeline or chasing down rogue ETL bugs, I’m happiest deep in the investigation - hands on the code, eyes on the patterns.  

Think of me as the one who doesn’t just move data around, but makes sense of it.  

🔍 **Current Case Files**  
- Building a RAG-powered HR assistant that can read policies, answer employee questions, and cut down “Hey, quick HR doubt…” messages.  
- Automating sales and marketing workflows with **n8n**, so the team spends less time clicking around CRMs and more time actually closing deals.

🧩 **Fun fact:**  
I still treat broken JSONs like crime scenes - every missing curly brace tells a story.
